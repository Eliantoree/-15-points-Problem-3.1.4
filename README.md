(15 points) Problem 3.1.4

The least common multiple of two naturals x and y is the smallest natural that both x and y divide. For example, lcm(8, 12) = 24 because 8 and 12 each divide 24, and there is no smaller natural that both 8 and 12 divide.

Find the least common multiple of 60 and 339.

Find the least common multiple of 233254 and 223453.

Describe a general method to find the least common multiple of two naturals, given their factorization into primes (and assuming that the factorization exists and is unique).

We have defined the factorial n! of a natural n to be the product of all the naturals from 1 through n, with 0! being defined as 1. Let p be an odd prime number. Prove that (p − 1)! is congruent to −1 modulo p. (Hint: Pair as many numbers as you can with their multiplicative inverses.)

Suppose that the naturals m1, . . . , mk are pairwise relatively prime and that for each i from 1 through k, the natural x satisfies x ≡ xi (mod mi) and the natural y satisfies y ≡ yi (mod mi). Explain why for each i, xy satisfies xy ≡ xiyi (mod mi) and x + y satisfies (x + y) ≡ (xi + yi) (mod mi). Now suppose that z1, · · · , zj are some naturals and that we have an arithmetic expression in the zi’s (a combination of them using sums and products) whose result is guaranteed to be less than M, the product of the mi’s. Explain how we can compute the exact result of this arithmetic expression using the Chinese Remainder Theorem only once, no matter how large j is.

(uses Java) Give a recursive definition of and a recursive static method for the natural subtraction function, with pseudo-Java header

natural minus (natural x, natural y).

On input x and y this function returns x−y if this is a natural (i.e., if x ≥ y) and 0 otherwise.

Let the finite sequence a0, a1, · · · , an be defined by the rule ai = b + i · c. Prove by induction on n that the sum of the terms in the sequence is (n + 1)(a0 + an)/2. (Hint: In the base case, n = 0 and so a0 is equal to an. For the induction case, note that the sum for n + 1 is equal to the sum for n plus the one new term an+1.)

Define S(n) to be the sum, for all i from 1 through n, of i(i+1)1 . Prove by induction on all naturals n (including 0) that S(n) = 1 − n+11 .

Consider a variant of Exercise 4.4.3, for $4 and $11 bills (made, we might suppose, by a particularly inept counterfeiter). What is the minimum number k such that you can make up $n for all n ≥ k? Prove that you can do so.

(10 points) Problem 3.4.6

A Fermat number is a natural of the form Fi = 22i + 1, where i is any natural. In 1730 Goldbach used Fermat numbers to give an alternate proof that there are infinitely many primes.

List the Fermat numbers F0, F1, F2, F3, and F4,

Prove that for any n the product F0 · F1 · … · Fn is equal to Fn+1 − 2.

Argue that no two different Fermat numbers can share a prime factor. Since there are infinitely many Fermat numbers, there must thus be infinitely many primes.
